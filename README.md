# Guhca - UHC Minecraft
This is a multiplayer UHC Minecraft plugin developed specifically for private use,
this means it may not work in another enviroment. This being said, at time of writing
I see no reason why it wouldn't.
<br><br>
Instead of following default vanilla multiplayer hardcore logic, when one player dies all
players die! This plugin also disables health regeneration and assigns all other
gamerules used within the server to streamline the resetting process.
<br><br>
Since it is designed for use only within our server, it also contains all of the
commands that we specifically find useful, these are constantly changing but a manifest will
always be finable in the plugin.yml
<br><br>
Feel free to steal any code that seems useful.
